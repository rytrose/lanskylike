# lanskylike
An implementation of the Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) strategies used by Paul Lansky in his album "Idle Chatter".

Implemented in python using [audiolazy](https://github.com/danilobellini/audiolazy).

# Notes
For an unknown reason, the `.wav` files written from audio data made in the audiolazy package save in a way that is pseudo-corrupt. However, all of the necessary data is there, and the file can be made right by opening and reencoding in Audacity or a similar software. This has been done for the files in this repo, but will need to be done for any other files made during further use.
